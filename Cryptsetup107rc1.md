### changes since version 1.0.6 ###

  * Various man page fixes. Also merged some Debian/Ubuntu man page fixes. (thanks to Martin Pitt)

  * Set UUID in device-mapper for LUKS devices.

  * Retain readahead of underlying device.

  * Display device name when asking for password. (thanks to Till Maas)

  * Check device size when loading LUKS header. Remove misleading error message later.

  * Add error hint if dm-crypt mapping failed. (Key size and kernel version check for XTS and LRW mode for now.)

  * Use better error messages if device doesn't exist or is already used by other mapping.

  * Fix make distcheck. (thanks to Mike Kelly)

  * Check if all slots are full during luksAddKey.

  * Fix segfault in set\_error (thanks to Oliver Metz).

  * Remove precompiled pot files. Fix uninitialized return value variable in setup.c.

  * Code cleanups. (thanks to Ivan Stankovic)

  * Remove unnecessary files from po directory. They will be regenerated by autogen.sh.

  * Fix wrong output for remaining key at key deletion. Allow deletion of key slot while other keys have the same key information.

  * Add missing AM\_PROG\_CC\_C\_O to configure.in

  * Remove duplicate sentence in man page (thanks to Till Maas).

  * Wipe start of device (possible fs signature) before LUKS-formatting.

  * Do not process configure.in in hidden directories.

  * Return more descriptive error in case of IO or header format error.

  * Use remapping to error target instead of calling udevsettle for temporary crypt device.

  * Check device mapper communication and warn user in case the communication fails. (thanks to Milan Broz)

  * Fix signal handler to proper close device. (thanks to Milan Broz)

  * write\_lseek\_blockwise: declare innerCount outside the if block, add -Wall to the default CFLAGS, fix some signedness issues (thanks to Ivan Stankovic)

  * Error handling improvement. (thanks to Erik Edin)

  * Add non-exclusive override to interface definition.

  * Refactor key slot selection into keyslot\_from\_option. Either autoselect next free keyslot or honor user choice (after checking).
